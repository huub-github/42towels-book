# 42 Towels Shop

The book is divided into three parts:

### Part I - Hacking preparations

Part one helps you to get you up and running and to understand and set up optional hacking tools.

### Part II - Challenge hunting

Part two gives an overview of the vulnerabilities found in the 42 Towels Shop including hints how to find and exploit them in the application.


_Please be aware that this book is not supposed to be a comprehensive
introduction to Web Application Security in general. For every category
of vulnerabilities present in the 42 Towels Shop you will find a brief
explanation - typically by quoting and referencing to existing content
on the given topic._

This book is a rebranded copy of _(don't click)_ [an open source book](https://www.gitbook.com/book/bkimminich/pwning-owasp-juice-shop). _It is considered cheating_ to look at the full source while still playing the CTF.
