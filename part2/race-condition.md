# Race Condition

> A race condition or race hazard is the behavior of an electronics,
> software, or other system where the output is dependent on the
> sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes a bug
> when events do not happen in the order the programmer intended.[^1]

<!-- -->

> Many software race conditions have associated computer security
> implications. A race condition allows an attacker with access to a
> shared resource to cause other actors that utilize that resource to
> malfunction, resulting in effects including denial of service and
> privilege escalation.
>
> A specific kind of race condition involves checking for a predicate
> (e.g. for authentication), then acting on the predicate, while the
> state can change between the time of check and the time of use. When
> this kind of bug exists in security-sensitive code, a security
> vulnerability called a time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) bug is
> created.[^2]

### Like any review at least three times as the same user

Any online shop with a review or rating functionality for its products
should be very keen on keeping fake or inappropriate reviews out. The
42 Towels Shop decided to give its customers the ability to give a "like" to
their favorite reviews. Of course, each user should be able to do so
only once for each review.

#### Hints

* Every user is (almost) immediately associated with the review they
  "liked" to prevent abuse of that functionality
* Did you really think clicking the "like" button three times in a row
  _really fast_ would be enough to solve a
  ★★★★★★ challenge?
